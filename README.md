# terra-rpc-loadbalancing-env

## ðŸ’¡ Introduction

This collection of playbooks provides a starting point for building a load-balanced RPC environment, and contains the following roles:
- grafana-server 
	- Deploys a grafana server listening on the standard port, ```3000```
- haproxy
	- Deploys an HAProxy instance to the target, sets TCP-based load balancing based on number of connections, and binds listening ports to ```1317```, ```9090```, ```26657```, and populates ```/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg``` with back-end IPs defined in ```vars/main.yml```
- node-exporter
	- Deploys node-exporters to each target, port ```9100```
- prometheus-server
	- Deploys a prometheus server, and populates prometheus.yml with scraping endpoints based on host: port defined in ```vars/main.yml```
- terra-nodes
	- Deploys full terra nodes, opens RPC endpoints
- firewall
	- Deploys ```allow``` rules with ```deny``` policy


## Getting started
Target machine IPs are defined in ```group_vars/all.yml```, and these variables are re-used throughout the playbook. As such, define your targets with the relevant public and private IPs. You also need to make sure that the targets are able to communicate locally, be that by existing in the same VPC and subnet, or using e.g. VPC peering. If you want them to communicate on public addresses in all instances, private IP variables need to be replaced with their public-IP counterparts (```group_vars/all.yml```) in all relevant places, or alternatively, by giving the ```_local``` variables the same values as their public counterparts in ```group_vars/all.yml```



## Usage
Scripts are provided to run each role against a pre-set host group target, based on the diagram below. These can be changed based on need. Hosts and groups are defined in ```inventory.yml```, pulling addressing information from ```group_vars/all.yml```

To configure monitoring, access your grafana server on port :3000 and start building dashboards. Nodes will have two endpoints: 9100 for general metrics, and :26660 for blockchain data. HAProxy will have :9100 accessible.

## Caveats
By default, ansible runs against the public IP:22 to deploy. If you are running from a VPN or a local host, change the inventory.yml targets' variables to their ```_local``` counterparts.

### Disk space needed
You need harddisk space to store the download, as well as the unpacked chain. Check the snapshot size, consider that it needs to be unpacked, and configure your resources accordingly

### Idempotency
The terra-nodes role will include the downloading and unpacking of the snapshot. Running it again will download the entire quicksync file once more, and there is not recommended. These tasks can be disabled by commenting out ```- include_tasks: download_extract_snapshot.yml``` in the ```roles/terra-nodes/tasks/main.yml``` file
